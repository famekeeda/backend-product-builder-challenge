# backend-product-builder-challenge
Technical assessment for Fame Keeda’s AI-first backend engineering role. Focused on campaign orchestration, LLM integrations, and high-scale data systems.

# 🧪 Fame Keeda — Backend Product Builder Challenge

Build backend systems that power real-time influencer marketing, campaign orchestration, and AI-driven automation. This is your chance to show us how you think, not just how you code.

---

## 📦 Repository Name: `fk-backend-product-challenge`

### 📝 Description:
This repo contains the technical assessment for candidates applying for the **Backend/API Developer (AI Integration)** role at Fame Keeda. The challenge is designed to simulate real-world use cases we handle at scale — spanning campaign workflows, LLM integrations, and streaming influencer analytics.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

We’re scaling **Fame Dash** and **Fame Konnect**—AI-powered platforms connecting brands with creators through smart orchestration, predictive insights, and trend automation. This challenge is your opportunity to demonstrate how you'd contribute to building the tech behind that.

It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing **two things really well.**

---

## 🧩 Choose-Your-Own-Adventure: Pick Any 2 Sections

| Track | Goal | Est. Time |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 🌀 **A. Campaign Orchestrator API** | Microservices that trigger events, fire webhooks, retry failed actions, and maintain state | 4 hrs |
| 💡 **B. AI Brief Generator** | Use an LLM + tools/function-calling to generate a campaign brief | 3 hrs |
| 📊 **C. Streaming Metrics Pipeline** | Process influencer engagement stats in real-time; expose analytics API | 4 hrs |
| 📈 **D. Batch ETL + Top Performer API** | Parse 10k CSV rows, compute engagement scores, expose top-performers | 3 hrs |

---

## 🌟 Bonus (Optional)

These are *not* expected — just fun ways to go the extra mile:

- 🌍 Deploy on **GCP / Cloud Run / Render** and share live endpoints  
- 🧠 Add **RAG/vector search** for personalized AI brief generation  
- 🔔 Build a **Slack/Telegram bot** for campaign status updates  
- 📈 Add observability with **logs, metrics, or Grafana dashboards**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Guidelines

Use what you're best at, but here’s what we love:

- **Languages:** TypeScript (Node.js), Python (FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite (for quick setup)
- **Queues/Streams:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, GCP Pub/Sub
- **AI/LLMs:** OpenAI, HuggingFace, Ollama, LangChain, Function Calling APIs

---

## 🚀 Deliverables

- ✅ A GitHub repo (this one or forked)
- ✅ A clean and thoughtful `README.md` (that’s this file!)
- ✅ API docs — Swagger, Postman collection, or cURL samples
- ✅ Clear folder structure, meaningful commits
- ✅ (Optional) Loom video (3–5 mins) walking through your architecture and decisions

---

## 📄 README Must Include:

- Which 2 tracks you chose and why
- How to run your project locally (`docker-compose up` preferred)
- What trade-offs, assumptions, and decisions you made
- Instructions for testing or simulating API calls

---

## 🧠 How You’ll Be Evaluated

| Criteria                        | Weight |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Architecture & Design Thinking | 25%    |
| Code Quality & Modularity      | 20%    |
| Correctness & Error Handling   | 20%    |
| AI/LLM Prompt + Tool Use       | 20%    |
| Documentation & DX             | 15%    |
| Bonus (If any)                 | 🌟     |

We’re most interested in your **thought process** — comments, docs, even "here's what I'd do next" notes help us see how you think.

## 🕐 Timeline & Submission

- **Time to complete:** 5–7 days from the date of receipt
- **Submit via email:** careers@famekeeda.com  
- **Subject line:** `Backend Challenge – <Your Name>`  
- **Repo visibility:** Public or invite us to your private repo

We respond to every candidate within 7 days of submission. Standout entries get a deep-dive call with our tech team.

## ✅ Tips for Success

- Scope consciously. **Nail 2 sections > rush 4**
- Don’t overengineer — make it clean, not complex
- Write secure, production-grade endpoints (e.g., auth, retries, caching)
- Real APIs are welcome, but good mocks are fine
- `.env.example` instead of hardcoding secrets

---

## 👋 Final Note

This is not a “test.” It’s your chance to **build something real**, just like we do every week. If you love blending AI with scalable backend systems, you’ll love this role.

We can’t wait to see what you create.
